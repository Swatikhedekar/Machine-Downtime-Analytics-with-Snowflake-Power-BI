## About Dataset
The readings represent continuous operational data collected from machines on each 
shop floor. These readings capture key parameters such as pressure, temperature, torque, 
and speed, providing insights into machine performance and health. The company has 
stored the machine operating data in a single table. Each row in the table corresponds to 
a single machine's operational reading on a given day.

The data has undergone transformations to enhance analysis, including renaming 
columns, casting data types, and mapping target class values.
